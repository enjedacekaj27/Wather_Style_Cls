Weather_Style_Classifier is a Python-based project that trains two image classifiers. 
The first model predicts whether the weather in an image is rainy or sunny, while the second model classifies the image as either realistic or artistic. 
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for image classification and model evaluation.

Key libraries include:

PyTorch: Used for building, training, and optimizing deep learning models.

torchvision: Provides datasets and data transformations for image preprocessing and augmentation.

PIL: Used for handling and manipulating images.

zipfile and os: Help manage file operations, such as extracting datasets and handling directories.

Together, these tools enable efficient data management, model training, and evaluation.
